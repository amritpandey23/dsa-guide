# Dynamic Programming - Traversal

## Scenario

Problems where making recursive calls need to redundant computation leading to inefficiencies. The result can be optimized by storing the results of previously computed operations in a data structure.

## Clue

Look for recursive problems where subproblems are overlapping or repetitive.
